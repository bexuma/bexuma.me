# Personal website
This website was build and designed by Bexultan Myrzatayev (me). I had a forked repository for my personal website before, but was not fully satisfied. I did not feel it was me, thus I wrote a site with clean and minimalistic design to serve a my business card. I did it because I am currently in a job search, and I want to feel myself comfortable while people come to my place. To learn more visit [bexuma.me](https://bexuma.me).
